# Problem Statement
## Application overview
<br>
Create a price alert application that triggers an email when the userâ€™s target price is
achieved.
<br>
Say, the current price of BTC is $28,000, a user sets an alert for BTC at a price of 33,000$.
The application should send an email to the user when the price of BTC reaches 33,000$.
Similarly, say, the current price of BTC is 35,000$, a user sets an alert for BTC at a price of
33,000$. The application should send an email when the price of BTC reaches 33,000$.
